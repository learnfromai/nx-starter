# Railway.com Deployment Implementation Summary

## üìã Implementation Overview

This document summarizes the Railway.com deployment configuration implemented for the Nx Starter project.

## ‚úÖ Files Created

### Railway Configuration
- **`railway.toml`** - Root-level Railway configuration for monorepo
- **`apps/api/railway.json`** - API service-specific configuration
- **`apps/web/railway.json`** - Web application-specific configuration
- **`.railwayignore`** - Files to exclude from Railway deployments

### Docker Support
- **`apps/api/Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage Node.js build for API
- **`apps/web/Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage static site build with nginx
- **`apps/web/nginx.conf`** - Production nginx configuration

### Environment Templates
- **`apps/api/.env.railway`** - Railway production environment template for API
- **`apps/web/.env.railway`** - Railway production environment template for Web

### CI/CD Integration
- **`.github/workflows/railway-deployment.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for Railway deployment

### Development Tools
- **`scripts/railway-dev.sh`** - Local development script with Railway-like environment

### Documentation
- **`docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive Railway deployment guide
- **Updated `README.md`** - Added Railway deployment section

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### API Service (Node.js Web Service)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Port**: Dynamic (`$PORT` provided by Railway)
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Build**: Uses webpack to bundle Node.js application
- **Dependencies**: Automatically resolved from generated `package.json`

### Web Application (Static Site)
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Server**: nginx in production
- **Build**: Static files served from `/dist/apps/web`
- **Health Check**: `/health` (nginx endpoint)

## üîß Build Process

### API Build Flow:
1. Install dependencies with pnpm
2. Build shared libraries (`pnpm run build:libs`)
3. Build API application (`pnpm run build:api`)
4. Generate standalone package.json with dependencies
5. Start with `node main.js`

### Web Build Flow:
1. Install dependencies with pnpm
2. Build shared libraries (`pnpm run build:libs`)
3. Build web application (`pnpm run build:web`)
4. Serve static files with nginx

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Railway CLI Deployment
```bash
# API Service
cd apps/api
railway login
railway up

# Web Application
cd apps/web
railway login
railway up
```

### Option 2: GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Automatically deploys on push to main branch
- Detects changes in affected applications
- Supports manual deployment triggers
- Includes health checks and rollback capabilities

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
- Uses provided Dockerfiles for containerized deployment
- Supports Railway's Docker build system
- Production-optimized with multi-stage builds

## üîí Security & Production Features

### Environment Variables
- Production-ready environment templates
- Secure JWT configuration
- CORS properly configured
- Database connection security

### Health Monitoring
- Built-in health check endpoints
- Railway health check integration
- Application monitoring and logging

### Performance Optimizations
- Gzip compression (nginx)
- Static asset caching
- Connection pooling for databases
- Graceful shutdown handling

## üìä Database Support

The configuration supports multiple database options:

1. **SQLite** (default) - Simple file-based database
2. **PostgreSQL** - Railway's managed PostgreSQL service
3. **MySQL** - Railway's managed MySQL service
4. **MongoDB** - External MongoDB or Railway MongoDB

## üîß Environment Variables Required

### API Service
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=$PORT` (Railway provides this)
- `HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-web-domain.railway.app`
- `JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret`
- `DATABASE_URL=your-database-url` (optional)

### Web Application
- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.railway.app`
- `VITE_USE_API_BACKEND=true`

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing with Railway Environment
```bash
# Test Railway-like environment locally
./scripts/railway-dev.sh

# Test build process
pnpm run build:railway
```

### Verification Steps
1. ‚úÖ Build process completes successfully
2. ‚úÖ API server starts and responds to health checks
3. ‚úÖ Web application builds and serves static files
4. ‚úÖ Environment variables are properly configured
5. ‚úÖ Database connections work (if configured)

## üìà Benefits

- **Easy Deployment**: One-command deployment to Railway
- **Auto-scaling**: Railway handles traffic scaling automatically
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling deployments with health checks
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-use pricing model
- **Developer Friendly**: Great DX with CLI and dashboard
- **Production Ready**: Includes monitoring, logging, and security

## üîó Next Steps

1. **Setup Railway Account**: Create account and connect GitHub repository
2. **Configure Secrets**: Add required environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. **Deploy Services**: Use CLI or GitHub Actions to deploy
4. **Setup Custom Domain**: Add custom domain in Railway dashboard (optional)
5. **Monitor**: Use Railway dashboard for monitoring and logs
